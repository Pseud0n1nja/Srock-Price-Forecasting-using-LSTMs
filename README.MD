Using Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) to predict the price of the iron_ore stock and using time lags as a feature.The model forecast iron ore prices for any given time window. Here we have considered for just 3 months/90days.
The network has a visible layer with 1 input, a hidden layer with 10/40/120 LSTM blocks or neurons, and an output layer that makes a single value prediction. The default sigmoid activation function is used for the LSTM blocks. The network is trained for 50 epochs and a batch size of 32 is used.
